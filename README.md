## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font"). This font is complimentary to Montserrat but gives clear definition between text and headers.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I have used [Colourmind](https://colormind.io/ "colourmind") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected the initial colour that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet, it can be seen [here](wireframes/colour_pallet.JPG "Generated Colour Pallet"). However when I tested the contrast of the colours in [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM"), the contrast ratio from the text colour to the background colour was not good enough and failed tests, they can be seen [here](wireframes/contrast-checker.JPG "Failed tests"). After adjusting the colours manually, I gained a pallet that still gave great impact and had great contrast, these are the results for the contrast checker are [here](wireframes/contrast-checker-adjusted.JPG "Adjusted Colour Pallet").


I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/new-colour-pallet.JPG)

 
 * #8C00B3 - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
 * #FFFDDF - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
 * #8E689B - This colour will be used on the contact form for added styling.
 * #92579F - This colour will be used as a backgroung behind any images used.
 * #121A18 - This colour will be used as a text colour also the navigation and footer background colour.

### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:


### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_desktop.png "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_tablet.png "Tablet wireframe")
### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_phone.png "Phone wireframe")

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the club logo which doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Desktop (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;
    ![Navigation bar](wireframes/nav-bar-desktop.JPG)
    -   Spanning the full width of the device and with all links (Home, About, Events, Contact) to navigate visible, this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

    -   In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

    ![Navigation bar on hover](wireframes/nav-bar-hover.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;
    -   For the user to know that a link has been clicked there is also a visual aid of the text changing colour.

    ![Navigation bar on focus](wireframes/nav-bar-focus.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;


+ Small devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
    - As the navigation bar would be unuseable in the desktop version on smaller devices, it takes on a hamburger style.

    \
    &nbsp;
![Nav bar on small devices](wireframes/nav-bar-small.JPG)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available then.

# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It The content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.
\
&nbsp;

I have encountered several issues during testing. 
 + I initially decided to create the site with a minimum width of 992px as my largest styling, however the site just did not look right so added an x-large screen size.

 + In my wireframes, I had designed to only have a 'Join Us' button on the larger screen sizes. While I was developing the site, this did not make sence. There was such a long scroll with it being a one-page site, I felt I needed to speed up the movement for someone who was instantly interested so included it on all screen sizes.

 + On actual smaller devices, instead of on Chrome Developer, the main navigation menu did not show the 'Contact' link. I simply changed the styling of the links and the changed the ul to flex-start and all is now clearly visable.

 + I was having issues with the navigation bar scrolling about 15px when I scrolled down on smaller devices whilst working on Chrome Developer. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out the issue, but when I tried the site on an acual device, the navigation bar stayed fixed as the code dictated. This was a bug in Chrome Developer and not with my site.

 + The main navigation on smaller devices was initially set to 90vh, however on testing on a physical device, the user could see the site scrolling at the bottom if they were to slide up or down. This looked very poor and clumsy on the eye, so I adjusted it to 100vh to cover it up.

 + I found that I was repeating alot of code in my style.css file in order to center items. I created a class to do this and then applied it whee needed.

 + All my buttons were styled completly differently. I added an animation to all buttons so there is a continuity between them all.

 + When I was validating HTML code, I had one error showing. This was in the contact form where I had a method of '#'. I was under the understanding that POST method should have been used, but when I did, it caused an error instead of going to my contact.html page. After a while I tried using GET and it worked solving my validation problem. The results of my validation for HTML and CSS are below.

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (contact.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-contact-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes/css-validate.JPG "W3C CSS")
\
&nbsp;

 + On testing on a physical mobile device, I thought that the google search bar looked odd, being white and my header a dark colour. For user experiance and to make it look cleaner and more fluid, I changed the colour to match using the following code.

 ```

 <meta name="theme-color" content="#121A18">


 ```

 + When going through my UX section, to ensure that all my goals were met for the project, I noticed that I had missed one, 'As a user, I want to know that the club is well established'. I adjusted the text in the welcome section to suit.
\
&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs

My learning has limited my use of the hamburger for smaller devices. It works nicely to open the menu up, but a tap of the hamburger again should close the menu down again. It does not do this, and the link has to be selected to enable the user to exit out of it. From my research it seems that all the streamline methods are using JavaScript and I am yet to learn this.
